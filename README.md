This library wraps .NET classes that are hard to use in scripting languages that can't sink events or are unable to fully support use of a class. Examples include:

1. System.Diagnostics.Process class terminates prematurley when directy accessed in scripted context.
2. Simplify use of XmlDoc and related classes.
